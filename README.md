A marketplace platform that simplifies shipping any type of marketplace. You can create a marketplace for daily or nightly bookings, sell products, or offer services that connect customers with providers.

The platform is user-friendly for both customers and providers. Providers can easily post their listings, while customers can quickly make bookings, purchases, or message providers. A review system encourages trust by allowing feedback from both customers and providers.

You can monetize your marketplace by taking a commission on every booking or product purchase made through the platform.

The marketplace is fully configurable with custom user types, allowing separate registration for providers and customers. You can add custom user fields to collect extra information during sign-up. Configure listing types to support bookings or product sales, and add custom listing fields to gather additional details before publishing. Easily manage categories for all listings.

The marketplace is fully brandable. Customize your logo, colors, navigation links, and footer. Design your landing page with content blocks such as hero sections, features, grids, and carousels. You can also add extra content pages to your marketplace.
